I found the first episode to be seriously fast paced, having to stop multiple times to get my bearings.
Thankful for the ability of being able to stop videos wherever we want.

Overall, my goal with this series is to tag along, write down the code by myself while paying attention.
I reckon its a decent practice when someone doesn't have enough motivation to endulge completely in programming.
